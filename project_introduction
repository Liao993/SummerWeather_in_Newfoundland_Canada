Newfoundland is one of the province in the Altantic Canada. 
Newfoundland is an island which only can be arrived by ferry or planes. 
Because of the bad weather, the best traveling season in Newfoundland is summer (June to August). 
Therefore, in this project, I grabed the wather data from NOAA(https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/datasets) 
and made some data visualization to see what time is the best time to visit Newfoundland.
